1.  (a) The residual plot will show randomly distributed residuals around 0. The variance is also approximately constant. (b) The residuals will show a fan shape, with higher variability for smaller $x$. There will also be many points on the right above the line. There is trouble with the model being fit here.

1.  (a) Strong relationship, but a straight line would not fit the data. (b) Strong relationship, and a linear fit would be reasonable. (c) Weak relationship, and trying a linear fit would be reasonable. (d) Moderate relationship, but a straight line would not fit the data. (e) Strong relationship, and a linear fit would be reasonable. (f) Weak relationship, and trying a linear fit would be reasonable.

1.  (a) Exam 2 since there is less of a scatter in the plot of final exam grade versus exam 2. Notice that the relationship between Exam 1 and the Final Exam appears to be slightly nonlinear. (b) (Answers may vary.) Exam 2 and the final are relatively close to each other chronologically, or Exam 2 may be cumulative so has greater similarities in material to the final exam. 

1.  (a) $r = -0.7$ $\rightarrow$ (4). (b) $r = 0.45$ $\rightarrow$ (3). (c) $r = 0.06$ $\rightarrow$ (1). (d) $r = 0.92$ $\rightarrow$ (2).

1.  (a) There is a moderate, positive, and linear relationship between shoulder girth and height. (b) Changing the units, even if just for one of the variables, will not change the form, direction or strength of the relationship between the two variables.

1.  (a) There is a somewhat weak, positive, possibly linear relationship between the distance traveled and travel time. There is clustering near the lower left corner that we should take special note of. (b) Changing the units will not change the form, direction or strength of the relationship between the two variables. If longer distances measured in miles are associated with longer travel time measured in minutes, longer distances measured in kilometers will be associated with longer travel time measured in hours. (c) Changing units doesn't affect correlation: $r = 0.636$.

1.  In each part, we can write the age of one partner as a linear function of the other. (a) $age_{P1} = age_{P2} + 3$. (b) $age_{P1} = age_{P2} - 2$. (c) $age_{P1} = 2 \times age_{P2}$. Since the slopes are positive and these are perfect linear relationships, the correlation will be exactly 1 in all three parts. An alternative way to gain insight into this solution is to create a mock data set, e.g. 5 women aged 26, 27, 28, 29, and 30, then find the husband ages for each wife in each part and create a scatterplot.
