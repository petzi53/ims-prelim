1.  Correlation: no units. Intercept: cal. Slope: cal/cm.

1.  Over-estimate. Since the residual is calculated as $observed - predicted$, a negative residual means that the predicted value is higher than the observed value.

1.  (a) There is a positive, very strong, linear association between the number of tourists and spending. (b) Explanatory: number of tourists (in thousands). Response: spending (in millions of US dollars). (c) We can predict spending for a given number of tourists using a regression line. This may be useful information for determining how much the country may want to spend in advertising abroad, or to forecast expected revenues from tourism. (d) Even though the relationship appears linear in the scatterplot, the residual plot actually shows a nonlinear relationship. This is not a contradiction: residual plots can show divergences from linearity that can be difficult to see in a scatterplot. A simple linear model is inadequate for modeling these data. It is also important to consider that these data are observed sequentially, which means there may be a hidden structure not evident in the current plots but that is important to consider.

1.  (a) First calculate the slope: $b_1 = R\times s_y/s_x = 0.636 \times 113 / 99 = 0.726$. Next, make use of the fact that the regression line passes through the point $(\bar{x},\bar{y})$: $\bar{y} = b_0 + b_1 \times \bar{x}$. Plug in $\bar{x}$, $\bar{y}$, and $b_1$, and solve for $b_0$: 51. Solution: $\widehat{travel~time} = 51 + 0.726 \times distance$. (b) $b_1$: For each additional mile in distance, the model predicts an additional 0.726 minutes in travel time. $b_0$: When the distance travelled is 0 miles, the travel time is expected to be 51 minutes. It does not make sense to have a travel distance of 0 miles in this context. Here, the $y$-intercept serves only to adjust the height of the line and is meaningless by itself. (c) $R^2 = 0.636^2 = 0.40$. About 40% of the variability in travel time is accounted for by the model, i.e. explained by the distance travelled. (d) $\widehat{travel~time} = 51 + 0.726 \times distance  = 51 + 0.726 \times 103 \approx 126$ minutes. (Note: we should be cautious in our predictions with this model since we have not yet evaluated whether it is a well-fit model.) (e) $e_i = y_i - \hat{y}_i = 168 - 126 = 42$ minutes. A positive residual means that the model underestimates the travel time. (f) No, this calculation would require extrapolation.

1.  (a) $\widehat{murder} = -29.901 + 2.559 \times poverty\%$. (b) Expected murder rate in metropolitan areas with no poverty is -29. 901 per million. This is obviously not a meaningful value, it just serves to adjust the height of the regression line. (c) For each additional percentage increase in poverty, we expect murders per million to be higher on average by 2.559. (d) Poverty level explains 70.52% of the variability in murder rates in metropolitan areas. (e) $\sqrt{0.7052} = 0.8398$.
