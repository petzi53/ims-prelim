This is the online version of the textbook *Introduction to Modern Statistics, Preliminary Edition*!
<!--
This book may be downloaded as a free PDF at [openintro.org](http://www.openintro.org).
--> The source code for the book can be found [on GitHub](https://github.com/openintrostat/ims).

::: {.underconstruction}
This is the preliminary edition of OpenIntro::Introduction to Modern Statistics.
As of March 2021 we have stopped making updates to the preliminary edition and we are focusing our efforts on finalizing the 1st edition of the book.
This page will be updated when the 1st edition is out later this year.

This book is a revamped version of OpenIntro::Introduction to Statistics with Randomization and Simulation, the 1st edition of which can be accessed at [openintro.org/book/isrs](https://www.openintro.org/book/isrs/).

Some sections of the preliminary edition do not contain end of section/chapter exercises, however [OpenIntro::Introduction to Statistics with Randomization and Simulation](https://www.openintro.org/book/isrs/) and [OpenIntro::Statistics](https://www.openintro.org/book/os/) have many exercises you can use alongside this book and both of these books are available for free.

[Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel](http://mine-cr.com/) <br> [mine\@openintro.org](mailto:mine@openintro.org){.email} <br> University of Edinburgh, Duke University, RStudio <br>

Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel is Senior Lecturer in the School of Mathematics at University of Edinburgh, Data Scientist and Professional Educator at RStudio, and Associate Professor of the Practice position at the Department of Statistical Science at Duke University.
Mine's work focuses on innovation in statistics and data science pedagogy, with an emphasis on computing, reproducible research, student-centered learning, and open-source education as well as pedagogical approaches for enhancing retention of women and under-represented minorities in STEM.
Mine works on integrating computation into the undergraduate statistics curriculum, using reproducible research methodologies and analysis of real and complex datasets.
She also organizes [ASA DataFest](https://ww2.amstat.org/education/datafest/), an annual two-day competition in which teams of undergraduate students work to reveal insights into a rich and complex data set.
Mine works on the [OpenIntro](openintro.org) project, whose mission is to make educational products that are free, transparent, and lower barriers to education.
As part of this project she co-authored three open-source introductory statistics textbooks.
She is also the creator and maintainer of [datasciencebox.org](https://datasciencebox.org/) and she teaches the popular Statistics with R MOOC on Coursera.
