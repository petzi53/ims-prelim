1.  (a) Observational study. 
(b) Dog: Lucy. Cat: Luna. 
(c) Oliver and Lily. 
(d) Positive, as the popularity of a name for dogs increases, so does the popularity of that name for cats.

1.  (a) Experiment. 
(b) Treatment: 25 grams of chia seeds twice a day, control: placebo. 
(c) Yes, gender. 
(d) Yes, single blind since the patients were blinded to the treatment they received. 
(e) Since this is an experiment, we can make a causal statement. However, since the sample is not random, the causal statement cannot be generalized to the population at large.

1.  (a) Non-responders may have a different response to this question,
    e.g. parents who returned the surveys likely don't have difficulty
    spending time with their children. (b) It is unlikely that the women
    who were reached at the same address 3 years later are a random
    sample. These missing responders are probably renters (as opposed to
    homeowners) which means that they might have a lower socio-economic
    status than the respondents. (c) There is no control group in this
    study, this is an observational study, and there may be confounding
    variables, e.g. these people may go running because they are
    generally healthier and/or do other exercises.

1.  (a) Randomized controlled experiment. 
(b) Explanatory: treatment group (categorical, with 3 levels). Response variable: Psychological well-being. 
(c) No, because the participants were volunteers. 
(d) Yes, because it was an experiment. 
(e) The statement should say "evidence" instead of "proof".

1.  (a) County, state, driver's race, whether the car was searched or
    not, and whether the driver was arrested or not. (b) All
    categorical, non-ordinal. (c) Response: whether the car was searched
    or not. Explanatory: race of the driver.
