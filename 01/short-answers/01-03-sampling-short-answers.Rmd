1.  (a) Population: all births, sample: 143,196 births between 1989 and
    1993 in Southern California. (b) If births in this time span at the
    geography can be considered to be representative of all births, then
    the results are generalizable to the population of Southern
    California. However, since the study is observational the findings
    cannot be used to establish causal relationships.

1.  (a) Population: all asthma patients aged 18-69 who rely on
    medication for asthma treatment. Sample: 600 such patients. (b) If
    the patients in this sample, who are likely not randomly sampled,
    can be considered to be representative of all asthma patients aged
    18-69 who rely on medication for asthma treatment, then the results
    are generalizable to the population defined above. Additionally,
    since the study is experimental, the findings can be used to
    establish causal relationships.

1.  (a) Observation. (b) Variable. (c) Sample statistic (mean).
    (d) Population parameter (mean).

1.  (a) Observational. (b) Use stratified sampling to randomly sample a fixed number of students, say 10, from each section for a total sample size of 40 students.

1.  (a) Positive, non-linear, somewhat strong. Countries in which a higher percentage of the population have access to the internet also tend to have higher average life expectancies, however rise in life expectancy trails off before around 80 years old. 
(b) Observational. 
(c) Wealth: countries with individuals who can widely afford the internet can probably also afford basic medical care. (Note: Answers may vary.)

1.  (a) Simple random sampling is okay. In fact, it's rare for simple random sampling to not be a reasonable sampling method! 
(b) The student opinions may vary by field of study, so the stratifying by this variable makes sense and would be reasonable. 
(c) Students of similar ages are probably going to have more similar opinions, and we want clusters to be diverse with respect to the outcome of interest, so this would **not** be a good approach. (Additional thought: the clusters in this case may also have very different numbers of people, which can also create unexpected sample sizes.)

1.  (a) The cases are 200 randomly sampled men and women. (b) The
    response variable is attitude towards a fictional microwave oven.
    (c) The explanatory variable is dispositional attitude. (d) Yes, the
    cases are sampled randomly. (e) This is an observational study since
    there is no random assignment to treatments. (f) No, we cannot
    establish a causal link between the explanatory and response
    variables since the study is observational. (g) Yes, the results of
    the study can be generalized to the population at large since the
    sample is random.

1.  (a) Simple random sample. Non-response bias, if only those people who have strong opinions about the survey responds their sample may not be representative of the population. (b) Convenience sample. Under coverage bias, their sample may not be representative of the population since it consists only of their friends. It is also possible that the study will have non-response bias if some choose to not bring back the survey. (c) Convenience sample. This will have a similar issues to handing out surveys to friends. (d) Multi-stage sampling. If the classes are similar to each other with respect to student composition this approach should not introduce bias, other than potential non-response bias.
