1.  (a) Exam performance. (b) Light level: fluorescent overhead
    lighting, yellow overhead lighting, no overhead lighting (only desk

1.  (a) Exam performance. (b) Light level (overhead lighting, yellow
    overhead lighting, no overhead lighting) and noise level (no noise,
    construction noise, and human chatter noise). (c) Since the
    researchers want to ensure equal gender representation, sex will be
    a blocking variable.

1.  Need randomization and blinding. One possible outline: (1) Prepare two cups for each participant, one containing regular Coke and the other containing Diet Coke. Make sure the cups ar identical and contain equal amounts of soda. Label the cups (regular) and B (diet). (Be sure to randomize A and B for each trial!) (2) Give each participant the two cups, one cup at a time, in random order, and ask the participant to record a value that indicates ho much she liked the beverage. Be sure that neither the participant nor the person handing out the cups knows the identity of th beverage to make this a double-blind experiment. (Answers may vary.)
