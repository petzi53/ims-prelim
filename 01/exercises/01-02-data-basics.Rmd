1.  **Air pollution and birth outcomes, study components.** 
Researchers collected data to examine the relationship between air pollutants and preterm births in Southern California. 
During the study air pollution levels were measured by air quality monitoring stations. 
Specifically, levels of carbon monoxide were recorded in parts per million, nitrogen dioxide and ozone in parts per hundred million, and coarse particulate matter (PM$_{10}$) in $\mu g/m^3$. 
Length of gestation data were collected on 143,196 births between the years 1989 and 1993, and air pollution exposure during gestation was calculated for each birth. 
The analysis suggested that increased ambient PM$_{10}$ and, to a lesser degree, CO concentrations may be associated with the occurrence of preterm births. [@Ritz+Yu+Chapa+Fruin:2000]

1.  **Buteyko method, study components.** 
The Buteyko method is a shallow breathing technique developed by Konstantin Buteyko, a Russian doctor, in 1952. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the Buteyko method can reduce asthma symptoms and improve quality of life. 
In a scientific study to determine the effectiveness of this method, researchers recruited 600 asthma patients aged 18-69 who relied on medication for asthma treatment. 
These patients were randomly split into two research groups: one practiced the Buteyko method and the other did not. 
Patients were scored on quality of life, activity, asthma symptoms, and medication reduction on a scale from 0 to 10. 
On average, the participants in the Buteyko group experienced a significant reduction in asthma symptoms and an improvement in quality of life. [@McDowan:2003]

1.  **Cheaters, study components.** 
Researchers studying the relationship between honesty, age and self-control conducted an experiment on 160 children between the ages of 5 and 15. Participants reported their age, sex, and whether they were an only child or not. The researchers asked each child to toss a fair coin in private and to record the outcome (white or black) on a paper sheet, and said they would only reward children who report white. [@Bucciol:2011]

    a.  Identify the main research question of the study.

    b.  Who are the subjects in this study, and how many are included?

    c.  The study's findings can be summarized as follows: *"Half the students were explicitly told not to cheat and the others were not given any explicit instructions. In the no instruction group probability of cheating was found to be uniform across groups based on child's characteristics. In the group that was explicitly told to not cheat, girls were less likely to cheat, and while rate of cheating didn't vary by age for boys, it decreased with age for girls."* How many variables were recorded for each subject in the study in order to conclude these findings? State the variables and their types.

1.  **Stealers, study components.** 
In a study of the relationship between socio-economic class and unethical behavior, 129 University of California undergraduates at Berkeley were asked to identify themselves as having low or high social-class by comparing themselves to others with the most (least) money, most (least) education, and most (least) respected jobs. 
They were also presented with a jar of individually wrapped candies and informed that the candies were for children in a nearby laboratory, but that they could take some if they wanted. 
After completing some unrelated tasks, participants reported the number of candies they had taken. [@Piff:2012]

    a.  Identify the main research question of the study.

    b.  Who are the subjects in this study, and how many are included?

    c.  The study found that students who were identified as upper-class took more candy than others. How many variables were recorded for each subject in the study in order to conclude these findings? State the variables and their types.

1.  **Migraine and acupuncture, variables.**
A migraine is a particularly painful type of headache, which patients sometimes wish to treat with acupuncture. 
To determine whether acupuncture relieves migraine pain, researchers conducted a randomized controlled study where 89 females diagnosed with migraine headaches were randomly assigned to one of two groups: treatment or control. 
The patients in the treatment group received acupuncture that was specifically designed to treat migraines. 
The patients in the control group received placebo acupuncture (needle insertion at non-acupoint locations). 
24 hours after patients received acupuncture, they were asked if they were pain free. What are the explanatory and response variables in this study?^[The data used in this exercise can be found in the **openintro** package: [`migraine`](http://openintrostat.github.io/openintro/reference/migraine.html).]

1.  **Sinusitis and antibiotics, variables.** 
Researchers studying the effect of antibiotic treatment for acute sinusitis compared to symptomatic treatments randomly assigned 166 adults diagnosed with acute sinusitis to one of two groups: treatment or control. 
Study participants either received either a 10-day course of an antibiotic (treatment) or a placebo similar in appearance and taste (control). 
At the end of the 10-day period, patients were asked if they experienced improvement in symptoms. What are the explanatory and response variables in this study?^[The data used in this exercise can be found in the **openintro** package: [`sinusitis`](http://openintrostat.github.io/openintro/reference/sinusitis.html).]

1.  **Palmer penguins.** Data were collected on 344 penguins living on three islands (Torgersen, Biscoe, and Dream) in the Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica. 
In addition to which island each penguin lives on, the data contains information on the species of the penguin (*Adelie*, *Chinstrap*, or *Gentoo*), its bill length, bill depth, and flipper length (measured in millimeters), its body mass (measured in grams), and the sex of the penguin (female or male).^[The data used in this exercise can be found in the **palmerpenguins** package: [`penguins`](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/reference/penguins.html).] Bill length and depth are measured as shown in the image.^[Artwork by [Allison Horst](https://twitter.com/allison_horst).]
