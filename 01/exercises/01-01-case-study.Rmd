1.  **Migraine and acupuncture.** 
A migraine is a particularly painful type of headache, which patients sometimes wish to treat with acupuncture. 
To determine whether acupuncture relieves migraine pain, researchers conducted a randomized controlled study where 89 females diagnosed with migraine headaches were randomly assigned to one of two groups: treatment or control. 
43 patients in the treatment group received acupuncture that is specifically designed to treat migraines. 
46 patients in the control group received placebo acupuncture (needle insertion at non-acupoint locations). 
24 hours after patients received acupuncture, they were asked if they were pain free. Results are summarized in the contingency table below. 
Also provided is a figure from the original paper displaying the appropriate area (M) versus the inappropriate area (S) used in the treatment of migraine attacks.^[The data used in this exercise can be found in the **openintro** package: [`migraine`](http://openintrostat.github.io/openintro/reference/migraine.html).]

    migraine %>%

      rename(Group = group) %>%

      kable_styling(full_width = FALSE)
    ```

    a. What percent of patients in the treatment group were pain free 24 hours after receiving acupuncture?
    
    b. What percent were pain free in the control group?
    
    c. In which group did a higher percent of patients become pain free 24 hours after receiving acupuncture?
    
    d. Your findings so far might suggest that acupuncture is an effective treatment for migraines for all people who suffer from migraines. However this is not the only possible conclusion that can be drawn based on your findings so far. What is one other possible explanation for the observed difference between the percentages of patients that are pain free 24 hours after receiving acupuncture in the two groups?

1.  **Sinusitis and antibiotics.** 
Researchers studying the effect of antibiotic treatment for acute sinusitis compared to symptomatic treatments randomly assigned 166 adults diagnosed with acute sinusitis to one of two groups: treatment or control. 
Study participants received either a 10-day course of amoxicillin (an antibiotic) or a placebo similar in appearance and taste. 
The placebo consisted of symptomatic treatments such as acetaminophen, nasal decongestants, etc. 
At the end of the 10-day period, patients were asked if they experienced improvement in symptoms. 
The distribution of responses is summarized below.^[The data used in this exercise can be found in the **openintro** package: [`sinusitis`](http://openintrostat.github.io/openintro/reference/sinusitis.html).]

    sinusitis %>%

      rename(Group = group) %>%
      kable() %>%
      kable_styling(full_width = FALSE)
    ```

    a.  What percent of patients in the treatment group experienced improvement in symptoms?

    b.  What percent experienced improvement in symptoms in the control group?

    c.  In which group did a higher percentage of patients experience improvement in symptoms?

    d.  Your findings so far might suggest a real difference in the effectiveness of antibiotic and placebo treatments for improving symptoms of sinusitis. However this is not the only possible conclusion that can be drawn based on your findings so far. What is one other possible explanation for the observed difference between the percentages patients who experienced improvement in symptoms?
