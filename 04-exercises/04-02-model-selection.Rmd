1.  **Absenteeism, Part II**
    Exercise [\[absent_from_school_mlr\]](#absent_from_school_mlr){reference-type="ref"
    reference="absent_from_school_mlr"} considers a model that predicts
    the number of days absent using three predictors: ethnic background
    (), gender (), and learner status (). The table below shows the
    adjusted R-squared for the model as well as adjusted R-squared
    values for all models we evaluate in the first step of the backwards
    elimination process.

          Model                 Adjusted $R^2$
      --- ------------------- ----------------
        1 Full model                    0.0701
        2 No ethnicity                 -0.0033
        3 No sex                        0.0676
        4 No learner status             0.0723

    Which, if any, variable should be removed from the model first?

1.  **Absenteeism, Part III**
    Exercise [\[absent_from_school_mlr\]](#absent_from_school_mlr){reference-type="ref"
    reference="absent_from_school_mlr"} provides regression output for
    the full model, including all explanatory variables available in the
    data set, for predicting the number of days absent from school. In
    this exercise we consider a forward-selection algorithm and add
    variables to the model one-at-a-time. The table below shows the
    p-value and adjusted $R^2$ of each model where we include only the
    corresponding predictor. Based on this table, which variable should
    be added to the model first?

      variable       ethnicity    sex     learner status
      ------------- ----------- -------- ----------------
      p-value         0.0007     0.3142       0.5870
      $R_{adj}^2$     0.0714     0.0001         0

1.  **Baby weights, Part IV**
    Exercise [\[baby_weights_mlr\]](#baby_weights_mlr){reference-type="ref"
    reference="baby_weights_mlr"} considers a model that predicts a
    newborn's weight using several predictors (gestation length, parity,
    age of mother, height of mother, weight of mother, smoking status of
    mother). The table below shows the adjusted R-squared for the full
    model as well as adjusted R-squared values for all models we
    evaluate in the first step of the backwards elimination process.

          Model                 Adjusted $R^2$
      --- ------------------- ----------------
        1 Full model                    0.2541
        2 No gestation                  0.1031
        3 No parity                     0.2492
        4 No age                        0.2547
        5 No height                     0.2311
        6 No weight                     0.2536
        7 No smoking status             0.2072

    Which, if any, variable should be removed from the model first?

1.  **Baby weights, Part V**
    Exercise [\[baby_weights_mlr\]](#baby_weights_mlr){reference-type="ref"
    reference="baby_weights_mlr"} provides regression output for the
    full model (including all explanatory variables available in the
    data set) for predicting birth weight of babies. In this exercise we
    consider a forward-selection algorithm and add variables to the
    model one-at-a-time. The table below shows the p-value and adjusted
    $R^2$ of each model where we include only the corresponding
    predictor. Based on this table, which variable should be added to
    the model first?

      variable             gestation         parity    age             height                  weight                  smoke

1.  **Movie lovers, Part II** Suppose an online media streaming company
    is interested in building a movie recommendation system. The website
    maintains data on the movies in their database (genre, length, cast,
    director, budget, etc.) and additionally collects data from their
    subscribers ( demographic information, previously watched movies,
    how they rated previously watched movies, etc.). The recommendation
    system will be deemed successful if subscribers actually watch, and
    rate highly, the movies recommended to them. Should the company use
    the adjusted $R^2$ or the p-value approach in selecting variables
    for their recommendation system?
