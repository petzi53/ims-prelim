1.  **Challenger disaster, Part I** On January 28, 1986, a routine
    launch was anticipated for the Challenger space shuttle.
    Seventy-three seconds into the flight, disaster happened: the
    shuttle broke apart, killing all seven crew members on board. An
    investigation into the cause of the disaster focused on a critical
    seal called an O-ring, and it is believed that damage to these
    O-rings during a shuttle launch may be related to the ambient
    temperature during the launch. The table below summarizes
    observational data on O-rings for 23 shuttle missions, where the
    mission order is based on the temperature at the time of the launch.
    *Temp* gives the temperature in Fahrenheit, *Damaged* represents the
    number of damaged O- rings, and *Undamaged* represents the number of
    O-rings that were not damaged.

    1.  Each column of the table above represents a different shuttle
        mission. Examine these data and describe what you observe with
        respect to the relationship between temperatures and damaged
        O-rings.

    2.  Failures have been coded as 1 for a damaged O-ring and 0 for an
        undamaged O-ring, and a logistic regression model was fit to
        these data. A summary of this model is given below. Describe the
        key components of this summary table in words.

            Temperature    -0.2162       0.0532     -4.07           0.0000

    3.  Write out the logistic model using the point estimates of the
        model parameters.

    4.  Based on the model, do you think concerns regarding O-rings are
        justified? Explain.

1.  **Challenger disaster, Part II**
    Exercise [\[challenger_disaster_model_select\]](#challenger_disaster_model_select){reference-type="ref"
    reference="challenger_disaster_model_select"} introduced us to
    O-rings that were identified as a plausible explanation for the
    breakup of the Challenger space shuttle 73 seconds into takeoff
    in 1986. The investigation found that the ambient temperature at the
    time of the shuttle launch was closely related to the damage of
    O-rings, which are a critical component of the shuttle. See this
    earlier exercise if you would like to browse the original data.

    ![](04-exercises/figures/challenger_disaster_damage_temp.png){width="60%"}

    1.  The data provided in the previous exercise are shown in the
        plot. The logistic model fit to these data may be written as
        $$\begin{aligned}
        \log\left( \frac{\hat{p}}{1 - \hat{p}} \right) = 11.6630 - 0.2162\times Temperature\end{aligned}$$
        where $\hat{p}$ is the model-estimated probability that an
        O-ring will become damaged. Use the model to calculate the
        probability that an O-ring will become damaged at each of the
        following ambient temperatures: 51, 53, and 55 degrees
        Fahrenheit. The model-estimated probabilities for several
        additional ambient temperatures are provided below, where
        subscripts indicate the temperature: $$\begin{aligned}
        &\hat{p}_{57} = 0.341
            && \hat{p}_{59} = 0.251
            && \hat{p}_{61} = 0.179
            && \hat{p}_{63} = 0.124 \\
        &\hat{p}_{65} = 0.084
            && \hat{p}_{67} = 0.056
            && \hat{p}_{69} = 0.037
            && \hat{p}_{71} = 0.024\end{aligned}$$

    2.  Add the model-estimated probabilities from part (a) on the plot,
        then connect these dots using a smooth curve to represent the
        model-estimated probabilities.

    3.  Describe any concerns you may have regarding applying logistic
        regression in this application, and note any assumptions that
        are required to accept the model's validity.

1.  **Possum classification, Part I** The common brushtail possum of the
    Australia region is a bit cuter than its distant cousin, the
    American opossum (see
    Figure [\[brushtail_possum\]](#brushtail_possum){reference-type="ref+page"
    reference="brushtail_possum"}). We consider 104 brushtail possums
    from two regions in Australia, where the possums may be considered a
    random sample from the population. The first region is Victoria,
    which is in the eastern half of Australia and traverses the southern
    coast. The second region consists of New South Wales and Queensland,
    which make up eastern and northeastern Australia. We use logistic
    regression to differentiate between possums in these two regions.
    The outcome variable, called , takes value 1 when a possum is from
    Victoria and 0 when it is from New South Wales or Queensland. We
    consider five predictors: (an indicator for a possum being male), ,
    , , and . Each variable is summarized in a histogram. The full
    logistic regression model and a reduced model after variable
    selection are summarized in the table.

    1.  Examine each of the predictors. Are there any outliers that are
        likely to have a very large influence on the logistic regression
        model?

    2.  The summary table for the full model indicates that at least one
        variable should be eliminated when using the p-value approach
        for variable selection: . The second component of the table
        summarizes the reduced model following variable selection.
        Explain why the remaining estimates change between the two
        models.

1.  **Possum classification, Part II** A logistic regression model was
    proposed for classifying common brushtail possums into their two
    regions in
    Exercise [\[possum_classification_model_select\]](#possum_classification_model_select){reference-type="ref"
    reference="possum_classification_model_select"}. The outcome
    variable took value 1 if the possum was from Victoria and 0
    otherwise.

    1.  Write out the form of the model. Also identify which of the
        variables are positively associated when controlling for other
        variables.

    2.  Suppose we see a brushtail possum at a zoo in the US, and a sign
        says the possum had been captured in the wild in Australia, but
        it doesn't say which part of Australia. However, the sign does
        indicate that the possum is male, its skull is about 63 mm wide,
        its tail is 37 cm long, and its total length is 83 cm. What is
        the reduced model's computed probability that this possum is
        from Victoria? How confident are you in the model's accuracy of
        this probability calculation?
