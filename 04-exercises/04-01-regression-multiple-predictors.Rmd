1.  **Absenteeism, Part I** Researchers interested in the relationship
    between absenteeism from school and certain demographic
    characteristics of children collected data from 146 randomly sampled
    students in rural New South Wales, Australia, in a particular school
    year. Below are three observations from this data set.

                    eth        sex        lrn        days
      ---------- ---------- ---------- ---------- ----------
               1     0          1          1          2
               2     0          1          1          11

             146     1          0          0          37

    The summary table below shows the results of a linear regression
    model for predicting the average number of days absent based on
    ethnic background (`eth`: 0 - aboriginal, 1 - not aboriginal), sex
    (`sex`: 0 - female, 1 - male), and learner status (`lrn`: 0 -
    average learner, 1 - slow learner). [@data:quine]

    1.  Write the equation of the regression model.

    2.  Interpret each one of the slopes in this context.

    3.  Calculate the residual for the first observation in the data
        set: a student who is aboriginal, male, a slow learner, and
        missed 2 days of school.

    4.  The variance of the residuals is 240.57, and the variance of the
        number of absent days for all students in the data set is
        264.17. Calculate the $R^2$ and the adjusted $R^2$. Note that
        there are 146 observations in the data set.

1.  **Baby weights, Part III** We considered the variables `smoke` and
    `parity`, one at a time, in modeling birth weights of babies in
    Exercises [\[baby_weights_smoke\]](#baby_weights_smoke){reference-type="ref"
    reference="baby_weights_smoke"}
    and [\[baby_weights_parity\]](#baby_weights_parity){reference-type="ref"
    reference="baby_weights_parity"}. A more realistic approach to
    modeling infant weights is to consider all possibly related
    variables at once. Other variables of interest include length of
    pregnancy in days (`gestation`), mother's age in years (`age`),
    mother's height in inches (`height`), and mother's pregnancy weight
    in pounds (`weight`). Below are three observations from this data
    set.

                    bwt      gestation    parity      age       height     weight     smoke
      ---------- ---------- ----------- ---------- ---------- ---------- ---------- ----------

    The summary table below shows the results of a regression model for
    predicting the average birth weight of babies based on all of the
    variables included in the data set.

                      Estimate   Std. Error   t value   Pr($>$$|$t$|$)
      ------------- ---------- ------------ --------- ----------------
        (Intercept)     -80.41        14.35     -5.60           0.0000
          gestation       0.44         0.03     15.26           0.0000

                age      -0.01         0.09     -0.10           0.9170
             height       1.15         0.21      5.63           0.0000
             weight       0.05         0.03      1.99           0.0471
              smoke      -8.40         0.95     -8.81           0.0000

    1.  Write the equation of the regression model that includes all of
        the variables.

    2.  Interpret the slopes of `gestation` and `age` in this context.

    3.  The coefficient for `parity` is different than in the linear
        model shown in
        Exercise [\[baby_weights_parity\]](#baby_weights_parity){reference-type="ref"
        reference="baby_weights_parity"}. Why might there be a
        difference?

    4.  Calculate the residual for the first observation in the data
        set.

    5.  The variance of the residuals is 249.28, and the variance of the
        birth weights of all babies in the data set is 332.57. Calculate
        the $R^2$ and the adjusted $R^2$. Note that there are 1,236
        observations in the data set.

1.  **Baby weights, Part II**
    Exercise [\[baby_weights_smoke\]](#baby_weights_smoke){reference-type="ref"
    reference="baby_weights_smoke"} introduces a data set on birth
    weight of babies. Another variable we consider is `parity`, which is
    1 if the child is the first born, and 0 otherwise. The summary table
    below shows the results of a linear regression model for predicting
    the average birth weight of babies, measured in ounces, from
    `parity`.

                      Estimate   Std. Error   t value   Pr($>$$|$t$|$)
      ------------- ---------- ------------ --------- ----------------
        (Intercept)     120.07         0.60    199.94           0.0000
             parity      -1.93         1.19     -1.62           0.1052

    1.  Write the equation of the regression model.

    2.  Interpret the slope in this context, and calculate the predicted
        birth weight of first borns and others.

    3.  Is there a statistically significant relationship between the
        average birth weight and parity?

1.  **Baby weights, Part I** The Child Health and Development Studies
    investigate a range of topics. One study considered all pregnancies
    between 1960 and 1967 among women in the Kaiser Foundation Health
    Plan in the San Francisco East Bay area. Here, we study the
    relationship between smoking and weight of the baby. The variable
    `smoke` is coded 1 if the mother is a smoker, and 0 if not. The
    summary table below shows the results of a linear regression model
    for predicting the average birth weight of babies, measured in
    ounces, based on the smoking status of the mother. [@data:babies]

                      Estimate   Std. Error   t value   Pr($>$$|$t$|$)
      ------------- ---------- ------------ --------- ----------------
        (Intercept)     123.05         0.65    189.60           0.0000
              smoke      -8.94         1.03     -8.65           0.0000

    The variability within the smokers and non-smokers are about equal
    and the distributions are symmetric. With these conditions
    satisfied, it is reasonable to apply the model. (Note that we don't
    need to check linearity since the predictor has only two levels.)

    1.  Write the equation of the regression model.

    2.  Interpret the slope in this context, and calculate the predicted
        birth weight of babies born to smoker and non-smoker mothers.

    3.  Is there a statistically significant relationship between the
        average birth weight and smoking?

1.  **Cherry trees** Timber yield is approximately equal to the volume
    of a tree, however, this value is difficult to measure without first
    cutting the tree down. Instead, other variables, such as height and
    diameter, may be used to predict a tree's volume and yield.
    Researchers wanting to understand the relationship between these
    variables for black cherry trees collected data from 31 such trees
    in the Allegheny National Forest, Pennsylvania. Height is measured
    in feet, diameter in inches (at 54 inches above ground), and volume
    in cubic feet. [@Hand:1994]

                      Estimate   Std. Error   t value   Pr($>$$|$t$|$)
      ------------- ---------- ------------ --------- ----------------
        (Intercept)     -57.99         8.64     -6.71             0.00
             height       0.34         0.13      2.61             0.01
           diameter       4.71         0.26     17.82             0.00

    1.  Calculate a 95% confidence interval for the coefficient of
        height, and interpret it in the context of the data.

    2.  One tree in this sample is 79 feet tall, has a diameter of 11.3
        inches, and is 24.2 cubic feet in volume. Determine if the model
        overestimates or underestimates the volume of this tree, and by
        how much.

1.  **GPA** A survey of 55 Duke University students asked about their
    GPA, number of hours they study at night, number of nights they go
    out, and their gender. Summary output of the regression model is
    shown below. Note that male is coded as 1.

                      Estimate   Std. Error   t value   Pr($>$$|$t$|$)
      ------------- ---------- ------------ --------- ----------------
        (Intercept)       3.45         0.35      9.85             0.00
          studyweek       0.00         0.00      0.27             0.79
         sleepnight       0.01         0.05      0.11             0.91
           outnight       0.05         0.05      1.01             0.32
             gender      -0.08         0.12     -0.68             0.50

    1.  Calculate a 95% confidence interval for the coefficient of
        gender in the model, and interpret it in the context of the
        data.

    2.  Would you expect a 95% confidence interval for the slope of the
        remaining variables to include 0? Explain
