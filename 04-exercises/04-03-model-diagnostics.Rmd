1.  **Baby weights, Part VI**
    ExerciseÂ [\[baby_weights_mlr\]](#baby_weights_mlr){reference-type="ref"
    reference="baby_weights_mlr"} presents a regression model for
    predicting the average birth weight of babies based on length of
    gestation, parity, height, weight, and smoking status of the mother.
    Determine if the model assumptions are met using the plots below. If
    not, describe how to proceed with the analysis.

1.  **Movie returns, Part I** A FiveThirtyEight.com article reports that
    "Horror movies get nowhere near as much draw at the box office as
    the big-time summer blockbusters or action/adventure movies \... but
    there's a huge incentive for studios to continue pushing them out.
    The return-on-investment potential for horror movies is absurd.\" To
    investigate how the return-on-investment compares between genres and
    how this relationship has changed over time, an introductory
    statistics student fit a model predicting the ratio of gross revenue
    of movies from genre and release year for 1,070 movies released
    between 2000 and 2018. Using the plots given below, determine if
    this regression model is appropriate for these data.
