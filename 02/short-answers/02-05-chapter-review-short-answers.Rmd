1.  (a) Decrease: the new score is smaller than the mean of the 24 previous scores. (b) Calculate a weighted mean. Use a weight of 24 for the old mean and 1 for the new mean: $(24\times 74 + 1\times64)/(24+1) = 73.6$. (c) The new score is more than 1 standard deviation away from the previous mean, so increase.

1.  No, we would expect this distribution to be right skewed. There are two reasons for this: there is a natural boundary at 0 (it is not possible to watch less than 0 hours of TV) and the standard deviation of the distribution is very large compared to the mean.

1.  The distribution of ages of best actress winners are right skewed with a median around 30 years. The distribution of ages of best actress winners is also right skewed, though less so, with a median around 40 years. The difference between the peaks of these distributions suggest that best actress winners are typically younger than best actor winners. The ages of best actress winners are more variable than the ages of best actor winners. There are potential outliers on the higher end of both of the distributions.

1.  The 75th percentile is 82.5, so 5 students will get an A. Also, by definition 25% of students will be above the 75th percentile.
